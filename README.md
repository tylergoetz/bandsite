# bandsite
## Info
### Frameworks in use
* Bootstrap<br>
* JQuery
### Desc
A site I made to test out some bootstrap skills that I have been working on, I really wanted a one-page design.
I used bootstrap for device scalability, and jquery to make things easier. All-in-all bootstrap made this quite an easy experience.
